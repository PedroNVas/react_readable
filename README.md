# Readable Project

This project is related to the second assessment from Udacity's React Nanodegree Program.

## Getting Start

### Back-End

This project expects to have a `api-server` runnig. Since the source code was provided to develop the application,
I have assumed that the server should be running locally. You can clone the repository in [here](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter).

All the REST API endpoints can be found in a README.md inside the repository.

### Requisites

This project was built using `npm`, so it is advised to use it instead of yarn.

* Npm is distributes with Node.js, so just download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 

### Installing and Running

```
git clone https://github.com/PedroNVas/react_readable.git
cd react_readable

npm install
npm start
```

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
